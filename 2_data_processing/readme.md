## 2. Data processing (indoor)

After a successfully acquisition of the data in the field the data needs to be processed to upgrade the data (UAV imagery (.jpg) and GCPs (.csv)) into geodata (orthomosaic, digital elevation model (.tiff)). There are several software on the market. 
Two will be used for this workhsop: 
* [Agisoft Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/) (*commercial*)
* [OpenDroneMap](https://www.opendronemap.org/webodm/) (*open source*)

#### 1. Sort

The acquiered data can be sorted by date and sensor. The micasense folder need an extra directory for the reference panels.

Let's start with the multispectral data!
